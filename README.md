# Python-ComputerVision-RealTimeDetection-SignLingo

Did you know that, according to the World Health Organization there are over 34 million children in the world suffering from disabling hearing loss? Even if those numbers are shocking, estimations point to an increase in the prevalecence of a 12% by 2050.

Although we initially lacked expertise in the area, our team was driven to make a positive impact on this problem.

That's why our team developed signlingo, an Android app that leverages CNNs through YOLOv8, to ease the learning curve of the sign language among the children.

The app offers a real-time detection of letters from the A-Z American Sign Language. Our intention is to extend this functionality to provide complete lessons to learn not only letters, but words and multiple languages, as a fun and gamified experience for kids.

Even if we poured countless hours to make it, we're not stopping there! We still have a long way to go.
